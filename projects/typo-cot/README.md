# typo-cot reproduction package

This package contains the public reproduction interface for **“Edited-Word
Activation Patching Reverses Selected Typo-Induced Answer Changes after
Tokenization.”**

The final paper is the primary experimental specification. Its canonical
SHA-256 is available from the catalog's single source of truth:

```bash
uv run --project projects/typo-cot typo-cot experiments source
```

See
[`docs/paper-experiments.md`](docs/paper-experiments.md) for the transcribed
operation matrix, denominators, target directory layout, and one-command-per-
experiment interface.

## Setup

From the repository root:

```bash
uv sync --project projects/typo-cot
```

Pair preparation additionally needs the GPU/LRP dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --project projects/typo-cot --extra lrp
```

## Available commands

The experiment catalog is implemented and does not require a GPU:

```bash
uv run --project projects/typo-cot typo-cot experiments list
uv run --project projects/typo-cot typo-cot experiments list --format json
uv run --project projects/typo-cot typo-cot experiments show cot-swap
uv run --project projects/typo-cot typo-cot experiments show clean-prefix-scan --format json
```

Each catalog entry includes its stable `target_command`, paper section, required
operation-specific arguments, cohort, intervention, readout, outputs, compute
class, and implementation status. Direct experiment runners are added in
separate reviewed PRs; only entries marked `implemented` are runnable.

## Prepare clean/edited pairs

`prepare-edited-pairs` performs the paper's input-preparation operation: greedy
clean generation, first-CoT-token AttnLRP targeting, up to four seeded
single-character edits, greedy edited generation, deterministic answer
extraction, and edited-word-final token alignment. Run it separately for each
model, benchmark, and targeting condition:

```bash
uv run --project projects/typo-cot --extra lrp typo-cot prepare-edited-pairs \
  --model google/gemma-3-4b-it \
  --benchmark gsm8k \
  --targeting attribution-4 \
  --num-edits 4 \
  --output-dir results/prepare-edited-pairs/gemma-3-4b-it/gsm8k/attribution-4
```

Use `--targeting random-4` for the within-item control sampled after excluding
the four Attribution-4 tokens. `--num-edits` selects how many of the sampled
targets to edit (1–4). The paper defaults are `--seed 42` and
`--max-new-tokens 512`; `--limit 1` is available for a GPU smoke run. A stopped
run can be continued with `--resume`.
The command writes:

- `pairs.jsonl`: versioned per-item clean/edited generations, target-attempt
  provenance, actual distinct edited-word spans, and clean/edited word-final
  token indices;
- `run.json`: frozen arguments, environment and dataset provenance, progress,
  failures, and record counts.

The target attempts and aligned words are deliberately separate. AttnLRP ranks
tokens, and the final paper reports that some lower-ranked attempts land outside
their intended token or share a word. The pair format preserves that behavior
instead of silently converting targeting into a word-level selector.
The complete field contract and coordinate conventions are documented in
[`docs/prepare-edited-pairs.md`](docs/prepare-edited-pairs.md).

Dataset cohort size follows the final paper setting rather than one global
MMLU cap. MMLU uses 100 examples per subject (5,700 items) for
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Gemma-3-12B-IT, and Gemma-3-27B-IT, and 50 per subject
(2,850 items) for the other paper models. MMLU-Pro uses 100 per subject for
every model. The selected cohort size and versioned selection rule are recorded
in `run.json` provenance.

## Tests

```bash
uv run --project projects/typo-cot pytest projects/typo-cot/tests/test_paper_experiment_catalog.py
uv run --project projects/typo-cot --extra lrp pytest projects/typo-cot/tests
```

The contract tests enforce the final-PDF fingerprint, complete operation list,
descriptive names, unique command slugs, CLI JSON schema, and documentation
coverage. The full suite also exercises pair preparation and its model, dataset,
prompt, answer-extraction, and AttnLRP adapters without downloading model
weights.

## Repository scope

Only the public experiment catalog, implemented runners, their runtime
dependencies, and tests are tracked here. Intermediate Exp1–20 scripts,
machine-specific configuration, and archived outputs are deliberately excluded
because they are not the paper's reproduction interface.
